2024-DON540,2024-DON540,2024-DON540,Assessment,"Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) that causes Ebola virus disease. MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease, MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. With 62 confirmed cases reported, this is the third largest MVD outbreak reported, with the&nbsp;majority of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, the likely date of onset of the first case and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation.&nbsp; On 30 September WHO assessed the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level. However, based on the evolution of the outbreak and ongoing investigations, this risk assessment may be revised. MVD is not&nbsp;easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). In addition, there are ongoing public health measures in place, including active surveillance in facilities and communities, testing suspected cases, isolation and treatment of cases and contact tracing.","[{'cause': 'Filoviridae family viruses', 'effect': 'Marburg virus disease (MVD)'}, {'cause': 'History of exposure to bats, caves, or mining', 'effect': 'Improved differentiation of viral hemorrhagic fevers from other infectious diseases'}, {'cause': 'Healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections', 'effect': 'Further spread of the disease'}, {'cause': 'Screening all persons entering health facilities and conducting inpatient surveillance.', 'effect': 'Prompt identification, isolation, and notification.'}, {'cause': 'Evolution of the outbreak and ongoing investigations', 'effect': 'Risk assessment may be revised'}, {'cause': 'Contact with the body fluids of a sick patient (or surfaces contaminated with these fluids)', 'effect': 'Potential transmission of MVD'}, {'cause': 'Active surveillance and testing of suspected cases', 'effect': 'Isolation, treatment, and contact tracing of cases'}]"
2024-DON538,2024-DON538,2024-DON538,Assessment,"Although
no cases of WNV have been documented in birds or horses in the country, it is
possible that the virus is circulating in these populations undetected. Despite
this, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, as
there is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public health
response measures have been implemented, as described above.&nbsp;The
risk of international dissemination of WNV from Barbados is low. The virus is
primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, with birds as the natural hosts.
There is no evidence to suggest that WNV spreads easily between humans or from
horses to mosquitoes. Therefore, the potential for widespread international
transmission remains low.&nbsp;Based
on these criteria, the overall risk related to the public health remains low.

2024-DON536,2024-DON536,2024-DON536,Assessment,"Since the first report of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 until now, human infections have been reported in 27 countries, spanning all six WHO regions. The majority of MERS-CoV cases (2205; 84%), have been reported in KSA, including this newly reported case.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. The new case reported is believed to have acquired MERS-CoV infection locally within KSA. However, the potential for international transmission is increased due to the fact that the individual visited Pakistan, while a high-risk contact traveled to South Asia within the 14-day follow-up period. Both individuals had arranged their travels prior to the occurrence of the event and before the test results of the case were obtained and disseminated.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur if there are delays in identifying the infection, particularly in countries that are not well-acquainted with the disease, as well as slow triage of suspected cases and delays in the implementation of standard infection prevention and control measures.&nbsp;WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.&nbsp;","[{'cause': 'Acquiring MERS-CoV infection locally within KSA', 'effect': 'A new case of MERS-CoV being reported'}, {'cause': 'The individual visited Pakistan and a high-risk contact traveled to South Asia with pre-arranged travel plans.', 'effect': 'There is an increased potential for international transmission of the MERS-CoV infection.'}, {'cause': 'Delays in identifying the infection, slow triage of suspected cases, and delays in implementing standard infection prevention and control measures', 'effect': 'Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur'}, {'cause': 'Delays in identifying the infection, slow triage of suspected cases, and delays in implementing infection prevention and control measures.', 'effect': 'Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur.'}]"

2024-DON534,2024-DON534,2024-DON534,Assessment,"This is the first human case of infection with a zoonotic influenza virus notified by Ghana. Laboratory testing confirmed the virus as an influenza A(H9N2) virus.The majority of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses occur due to contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated and typically result in mild clinical symptoms. Further human cases in persons with exposure to the virus in infected animals or through contaminated environments can be expected since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. To date, there has been no reported sustained human-to-human transmission humans of A(H9N2) viruses.The existing epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival.

2024-DON532,2024-DON532,2024-DON532,Assessment,"Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been reported in recent years from many countries. Most human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or indirectly through contaminated environments. However, a few cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has never been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H1N1)v viruses associated with this case have been detected.Based on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.

2024-DON533,2024-DON533,2024-DON533,Assessment,"From
2003 to 20 August 2024, a total of 903 human cases of infection of influenza
A(H5N1) have been reported globally to WHO from 24 countries, including this
case. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have
been linked to close contact with A(H5N1)-infected live or dead birds or
mammals, or contaminated environments. Available
epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not
acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the
likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low at present. Since the
virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in
Cambodia, further sporadic human cases can be expected. Currently,
based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk
posed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed
if additional information becomes available.&nbsp;Close
analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most
recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and
serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to public
health and promptly adjust risk management measures.&nbsp;Vaccines
against seasonal influenza viruses will not protect humans against infections
with influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5)

2024-DON528,2024-DON528,2024-DON528,Assessment,"The current expansion of mpox in the African continent is unprecedented. At least four countries have identified cases for the first time and others, such as C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, are reporting re-emerging outbreaks. The modes of transmission in these countries are not fully described yet and are likely to include exclusive human-to-human transmission.&nbsp;Clade I mpox is being identified for the first time outside of the countries that had been previously affected. Initial transmission in the newly affected countries in East Africa and beyond has been linked to travel to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the expansion of the outbreak in Burundi suggests that in some settings, there may already be sustained community transmission. Epidemiological links between confirmed cases are not always known, therefore, multiple transmission chains might be ongoing in the different countries, and more undetected cases in the community are likely. Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas or congregate settings with high population density as well in high-risk sexual networks, transmission could lead to explosive outbreaks, further compounded by population movements or insecurity. Conversely, the virus can also spread silently along commercial travel routes as in some cases symptoms may be less severe, access to health services in transit may be limited or concerns about stigma may cause persons affected to avoid seeking care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While vaccination against smallpox was shown in the past to be cross-protective against mpox, any immunity from smallpox vaccination will only be present in persons over the age of 42 to 50 years or older, since natural exposure to smallpox and smallpox vaccination programmes ended in 1980 after smallpox eradication. None of the four newly affected countries has access to mpox vaccines or antivirals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above, WHO has separately assessed the risk of mpox in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries as high and in Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, and other West African countries as moderate. This risk applies to the general population, especially those who have sexual contact with a mpox case, as well as health workers if they are not taking appropriate precautions when examining, testing and treating mpox cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently no deaths have been reported in the five above mentioned countries, however, there is the potential for increased health impact with wider spread among vulnerable groups such as children, immunocompromised individuals, including persons with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, or pregnant women in whom mpox can be more severe.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is concern that the mpox outbreak in Africa will continue to evolve given:&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of possible under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission. Many reported cases have no established epidemiological link and have been identified in different countries and in different locations within each country.&nbsp;&nbsp;While all of the governments have activated emergency responses in the countries, with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond remain limited in some of the countries, and resource mobilization may be slow. Technical and financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at national and provincial/local levels.&nbsp;Although the governments and partners are all mobilized to support adequate patient care for affected patients and introduce vaccines for people at risk, these measures are currently not in place in most countries in Africa, and their acquisition and roll-out will still require some time for implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some of the countries have not reported mpox before, public awareness of the disease, as well as knowledge about and capacity for identifying it among health and care workers in newly affected countries remains limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, the global multi-country outbreak of mpox is still ongoing. Countries outside of Africa that seemed to have achieved control of human-to-human transmission continue to detect sporadic cases ` outbreaks, and an unprecedented increase of cases and reporting countries has been observed in the African Region, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the risk of further transmission in the region and the whole world.&nbsp;","[{'cause': 'Likely exclusive human-to-human transmission', 'effect': 'Unprecedented expansion and re-emergence of mpox outbreaks, including the detection of Clade I mpox in new regions'}, {'cause': 'Travel to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo', 'effect': 'Initial transmission of the outbreak in newly affected countries in East Africa and beyond'}, {'cause': 'Epidemiological links between confirmed cases are not always known', 'effect': 'Multiple transmission chains might be ongoing in the different countries, and more undetected cases in the community are likely'}, {'cause': 'High population density and high-risk sexual networks in congregate settings', 'effect': 'Explosive outbreaks due to virus transmission'}, {'cause': 'Lack of access to mpox vaccines, antivirals, and sufficient response resources, compounded by under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission.', 'effect': 'An increased risk of the mpox outbreak evolving and having a greater health impact on vulnerable populations.'}, {'cause': 'Some countries have not reported mpox before.', 'effect': 'Public awareness of the disease, as well as the knowledge about and capacity for identifying it among health and care workers, remains limited.'}, {'cause': 'Continued detection of sporadic cases and outbreaks outside of Africa.', 'effect': 'An unprecedented increase of cases and reporting countries in the African Region, heightening the risk of further transmission worldwide.'}]"
2024-DON527,2024-DON527,2024-DON527,Assessment,"Globally, there is no systematic surveillance that allows for the routine identification and information collection of hvKp strains. Identification of hvKp is challenging given that it is determined by available laboratory capacity to perform genomic sequencing tests or analysis of specific markers that may indicate hypervirulence, so the prevalence of hvKp-associated infections may be underestimated.&nbsp;Assessing the current risk of hvKp at the global level aims to incorporate several risk components including 1) the emergence and sustained transmission of hvKp carrying carbapenem resistance genes, considering the public health impact of the identified resistance for the AMR related events; 2) the risk of geographical spread; 3) the risk of insufficient control capacities with available resources; and 4) the risk of resistance spread to other bacterial species via mobile genetic elements.&nbsp;The risk at the global level is assessed as moderate considering that:&nbsp;Infections caused by hvKp traditionally have occurred within communities in certain geographical regions (Asia) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as high pathogenicity and limited antibiotic choices. However, recent reports from the WHO European region and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have shown transmission in health-care settings, and several studies from China have reported clusters of health care-associated infections of hvKp; hence highlighting the importance of strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when managing these cases in health-care settings. With the concurrence of hypervirulence and antibiotic resistance, it is expected that there will be an increased risk of spread of these strains at both the community and hospital levels.&nbsp;As with other resistance mechanisms, the risk of spread could increase due to high movements of people (within and between countries and regions).&nbsp;There are very limited antimicrobial treatment options for the carbapenem-resistant hvKp isolates and these strains have the capacity to generate outbreaks.&nbsp;The high conjugation capacity of the carbapenem-resistant hvKp (CR-hvKp) and the potential for further dissemination in clinical settings; hvKp ST23 particularly out-competes other gut bacteria facilitating colonization and spread.&nbsp;Detection of the emergence of multi-resistant or extensively resistant pathogens requires established resistance laboratory surveillance systems as well as effective infection prevention and control programs in health-care facilities.&nbsp;Lack of laboratory capacity contributes to the restriction of laboratory diagnosis, and this affects the sensitivity of the surveillance. Most affected countries do not have the capacity for diagnosis in the clinical setting as the laboratory diagnosis of hvKp infections depends on the availability of molecular tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is global heterogeneity in laboratory surveillance capacity for this pathogen; because of this, there is no systematic surveillance (detection, monitoring, and reporting) of hvKp infections in most countries or regions. Outbreaks and cases are documented in a non-systematic way through laboratory surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, or retrospective epidemiological studies, making data on the prevalence of hvKp infections scarce.&nbsp;The prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant hvKp poses significant challenges because it has not been possible to establish the extent of its dissemination in the countries of the different regions and information on this subject is currently limited.&nbsp;The level of confidence in the available information and risk assessment at the global level is moderate given the challenges with surveillance, lack of information on laboratory testing rates, ability to track and determine scale of community transmission, the gap in the available data on infections, hospitalization and from the overall burden of the disease.","[{'cause': 'Limited laboratory capacity for genomic sequencing and marker analysis to identify hvKp strains.', 'effect': 'Underestimation of the prevalence of hvKp-associated infections.'}, {'cause': 'Concurrence of hypervirulence and antibiotic resistance', 'effect': 'Increased risk of spread of these strains at both the community and hospital levels'}, {'cause': 'Lack of laboratory diagnostic capacity and molecular tests for hvKp infections.', 'effect': 'Absence of systematic surveillance and scarce data on the prevalence and dissemination of hvKp infections.'}]"

2024-DON525,2024-DON525,2024-DON525,Assessment,"The sudden appearance of unlinked cases of mpox in South Africa without a history of international travel, the high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case fatality ratio suggest that community transmission is underway, and the cases detected to date represent a small proportion of all mpox cases that might be occurring in the community; it is unknown how long the virus may have been circulating. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection with which South Africa previously gained little experience during the ongoing global outbreak, potential pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease, or delays in care-seeking behaviour due to limited access to care or fear of stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most of the transmission in the initial cases is linked to recent sexual contacts among men, similar to the spread in newly affected countries during the 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak. For most confirmed cases, no epidemiological link has been established, possibly due in part to incomplete contact identification. This suggests that undetected community transmission is occurring and that further cases can be expected as surveillance is strengthened. The current risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender diverse people, and sex workers is moderate, as currently assessed for the global outbreak. The higher risk assessment is consistent with ongoing transmission among recognized risk groups due mainly to exposure through sexual contact, and the higher prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection in the country which also puts people at risk of severe disease. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination continue in vulnerable groups in South Africa or neighbouring countries. Data from ongoing mpox outbreaks show that the risk of severe disease and death is higher among children, immunocompromised individuals including persons with poorly controlled HIV, and pregnant women.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data estimate HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in South Africa to be around 30%, only 44% of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. This makes this group extremely vulnerable to severe mpox disease and death. There is also a hazard to health workers if they are not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with mpox.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2022, the CFR for clade II MPXV in West Africa was estimated to be 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%, 6.8%). Case fatality in the ongoing multi-country outbreak (0.2%) is the lowest recorded for MPXV clade II. In contrast, the CFR among cases reported in South Africa in 2024 is extremely high (15%), as most detected cases are among persons who are immunocompromised with uncontrolled HIV and other co-morbidities. Persons with less severe mpox are less likely to recognize the condition or seek diagnosis and care; therefore, such cases may remain undetected and unreported.&nbsp;Vaccination with mpox vaccines has been shown to be effective against mpox. The last case of smallpox in South Africa was reported in 1972, and smallpox vaccination stopped shortly after the global eradication of the disease in 1980. Thus, any immunity from prior smallpox vaccination (which is cross-protective for mpox) will at best now only be present in some persons over the age of 44 years. The median age of mpox cases in the current global outbreak is 34 years (IQR: 29 - 41) and within South Africa, reported cases are aged between 17-43 years.&nbsp;The limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about practices for prevention among health workers and among key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exacerbates their risk for mpox. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may experience fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for key populations.&nbsp;There is concern that the mpox outbreak in South Africa will continue to evolve given:&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;high likelihood of under-detection and under-reporting&nbsp;of local transmission, given that reported cases have to date almost exclusively affected the most vulnerable.Currently, all detected cases have presented with severe&nbsp;disease and extensive skin lesions, which could lead to more viral transmission and risks poor outcomes for the patients.&nbsp;While the government and partners are mobilized to introduce treatment for affected patients and vaccines for people at risk, these countermeasures are&nbsp;not yet widely available in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public awareness&nbsp;of mpox&nbsp;and information about modes of transmission or possible amplifying events or risk of exposure in sex-on-premises venues remains&nbsp;limited in South Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent&nbsp;outbreaks of mpox are occurring in Africa and elsewhere, increasing the risk of further transmission.&nbsp;","[{'cause': 'Lack of early clinical recognition of mpox infection, potential pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease, and delays in care-seeking behavior due to limited access to care or fear of stigma.', 'effect': 'Community transmission of mpox is underway with many cases undetected, reflected in the small proportion of epidemiologically linked cases and the unexpected sudden appearance of unlinked mpox cases in South Africa.'}, {'cause': 'Incomplete contact identification.', 'effect': 'Undetected community transmission and the expectation of further cases as surveillance is strengthened.'}, {'cause': 'Exposure through sexual contact and a higher prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection.', 'effect': 'Ongoing transmission among recognized risk groups and an increased risk of severe disease.'}, {'cause': 'Exposure through sexual contact and the high prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection among recognized risk groups.', 'effect': 'Increased risk assessment and higher risk of severe disease.'}, {'cause': 'Not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with mpox.', 'effect': 'An increased hazard to health workers.'}, {'cause': 'Not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for mpox patients', 'effect': 'Hazard to health workers'}, {'cause': 'Persons with less severe mpox are less likely to recognize the condition or seek diagnosis and care.', 'effect': 'Such cases may remain undetected and unreported.'}, {'cause': 'Limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about prevention practices among health workers and key populations.', 'effect': 'Exacerbated risk for mpox.'}, {'cause': 'Limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about prevention practices among health workers and key populations', 'effect': 'Exacerbated risk for mpox among these groups'}, {'cause': 'Concurrent outbreaks of mpox in Africa and elsewhere', 'effect': 'Increasing the risk of further transmission'}]"
2024-DON522,2024-DON522,2024-DON522,Assessment,"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, most reported cases in known endemic provinces continue to be among children under 15 years of age, especially in young children. Infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death, particularly where prompt optimal case management is limited or unavailable. The number of cases reported weekly remains consistently high while the outbreak continues to expand geographically. High test positivity among tested cases in most provinces also suggests that undetected transmission is likely ongoing in the community.&nbsp;Transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV via sexual contact in key populations was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. In South Kivu province, mpox transmission is sustained through human-to-human contact (sexual and non-sexual).&nbsp; &nbsp;The global outbreak 2022 &mdash; 2024 has shown that sexual contact enables faster and more efficient spread of the virus from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes between people, contact with multiple partners, a possibly shorter incubation period on average, and a longer infectious period for immunocompromised individuals. The newly documented occurrence of mpox in North Kivu is very concerning. The additional public health impact of sustained human-to-human sexual transmission of mpox in the country indicates that a vigorous response is required.&nbsp;One of the main risk factors for severe disease and death among persons with mpox is immune suppression, especially among those with advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in the general adult population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be approximately 1%, higher in the eastern provinces than elsewhere, and higher in key populations including estimates of a prevalence of 7.5% among sex workers and 7.1% among men who have sex with men. The higher HIV prevalence and the challenge in accessing antiretroviral treatment puts these groups at higher risk for severe mpox and death if they get infected. The occurrence of cases among a broad range of occupational groups and within households also suggests that the outbreak in South Kivu is already spreading into the wider community.&nbsp;Understanding of the dynamics of MPXV transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is improving with the emergency measures being put in place. Nonetheless, a lack of timely access to diagnostics in many areas, incomplete epidemiological investigations, challenges in contact tracing and extensive but inconclusive animal investigations continue to hamper rapid response. While zoonotic spill over events are considered to still represent a major source of exposure in the country, the animal reservoir remains unknown. The new features of human-to-human transmission observed in South Kivu and North Kivu raise additional concern about a further rapid expansion of the outbreak in the eastern mining provinces, as well as the rest of the country and other countries which share national borders.&nbsp;From 1 January to 26 May 2024, 7 851 suspected cases were reported, compared to 3 924 suspected cases reported during the same period in 2023. The geographic expansion to new areas, such as Kinshasa and North Kivu, continues in 2024. Only 3 of 26 provinces have not yet reported mpox in 2024. While some cases in the newly affected provinces are linked to travel from endemic areas, others represent secondary or sustained human-to-human transmission, and the source of infection for several of them remains unknown. The current situation remains extremely concerning as MPXV continues to move into the immunity gap left following eradication of smallpox. &nbsp;Surveillance and investigating alerts are limited by logistical and resource challenges, and laboratory capacities are limited to two national laboratories, one in Kinshasa and one in Goma so only 18% of reported cases in 2024 have been tested by PCR. Testing through GeneXpert has begun in Equateur and South Kivu province, and validation of the findings is ongoing. Response capacities to mpox in the country rely to a great extent on the support of WHO and other partners.&nbsp;Immunogenicity and safety studies of MVA-BN vaccine have been ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2016. The national immunization technical advisory group (GTCV) released recommendations on the use of mpox vaccines in the country for persons at risk. These included recommendations for preferred use of LC16 in children and use of MVA-BN in adults. The Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention (MSPHP) has announced its intention to vaccinate persons at risk through use of LC16 and MVA-BN vaccinia-based mpox vaccines and asked the national regulatory authority (ACOREP),) to authorize temporary use of these vaccines. This regulatory review is underway. Further clinical efficacy and safety studies are being planned for LC16 in the country. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) is developing emergency response immunization strategies for persons and areas at risk through extensive consultation internally, with WHO and with partners.&nbsp;The antiviral medication tecovirimat is undergoing clinical efficacy studies in two study sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Kole in Sankuru Province and Tunde in Maniema Province. This study is expected to complete recruitment in 2024. Access to tecovirimat is possible through request from WHO for compassionate use or through application for use under the WHO MEURI protocol.&nbsp;Risk communication and community engagement are of critical importance for modes of transmission historically reported as community outbreaks including from consumption of bushmeat, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among sex workers and other key populations. According to a study conducted by USAID and Breakthrough Action in 2022, awareness of the risks associated with mpox among the general population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was low, despite the disease being reported in remote endemic areas since 1970. The lack of effective dissemination to date of health messages for key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exposes them to further risk. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may suffer from fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for persons at risk of acquiring the disease through sexual contact.&nbsp;The continued development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to:&nbsp;The continuing high incidence of cases reported in 2024 compared to previous years, with two thirds of reported cases and more than four fifths of deaths occurring primarily among children in known endemic areas.&nbsp;Transmission through sexual contact of clade I MPXV among key populations and other groups with multiple partners and high mobility in densely populated mining areas has led to sustained community transmission in South Kivu.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak characterized by sexual contact transmission has revealed a new strain of MPXV with genetic mutations suggestive of extended human-to-human transmission and geographic expansion. This new MPXV strain is affecting newly reported areas in southern and eastern provinces. While it is not known whether this variant is inherently more transmissible or leads to more severe diseases than other virus strains circulating in the country, co-infections with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are being documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2023 and 2024, mpox cases have occurred in ​​Kinshasa associated with river boat travel and leading to outbreaks in the city. At the time of reporting, new cases in the Nsele health zone in Kinshasa have been confirmed.&nbsp;There is high (around 70% overall) or very high (around 90% in South Kivu) test positivity among reported cases, despite efforts to significantly expand surveillance. This suggests significant under detection or underreporting of transmission.&nbsp;While the government has activated an emergency response across the country with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond over such a wide geographic area remain insufficient, and resource mobilization is slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public awareness remains limited, resources are scarce, and technical as well as financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at provincial/local, national, and international levels.&nbsp;A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the Republic of Congo, with cases genetically similar to the MPXV strain circulating in neighbouring endemic provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo provinces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new outbreak of mpox due to clade IIb MPXV linked to the ongoing global outbreak is occurring among key populations in the Republic of South Africa, with to date only cases with severe disease and advanced HIV infection being reported, suggesting extensive undetected circulation of the virus. Travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo linked to commercial activity between the two countries further puts populations at risk.&nbsp;In epidemiological week 16 to 18, an outbreak of 45 suspected cases of mpox were reported in two prison cells in Lodja Health Zone in Sankuru Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Samples were collected and sent to the lab for confirmation and results are currently awaited.","[{'cause': 'Limited or unavailable prompt optimal case management', 'effect': 'Increased risk of severe disease and death among infants and children under five years of age'}, {'cause': 'Sexual contact in key populations', 'effect': 'Transmission and accelerated, efficient spread of the mpox virus'}, {'cause': 'Sexual contact between individuals.', 'effect': 'Faster and more efficient spread of the mpox virus.'}, {'cause': 'Sustained human-to-human sexual transmission of mpox and its additional public health impact', 'effect': 'A vigorous response is required to address the increased risk'}, {'cause': 'The higher HIV prevalence and the challenge in accessing antiretroviral treatment', 'effect': 'These factors put these groups at higher risk for severe mpox and death if they get infected'}, {'cause': 'Lack of timely access to diagnostics, incomplete epidemiological investigations, challenges in contact tracing, and inconclusive animal investigations.', 'effect': 'Hampered rapid response to the outbreak.'}, {'cause': 'The new features of human-to-human transmission observed in South Kivu and North Kivu.', 'effect': 'A further rapid expansion of the outbreak in the eastern mining provinces, the rest of the country, and other neighboring countries.'}, {'cause': 'The eradication of smallpox, which created an immunity gap.', 'effect': 'MPXV spreading into the immunity gap, leading to increased and sustained mpox transmission.'}, {'cause': 'Limited laboratory capacity with only two national laboratories (Kinshasa and Goma)', 'effect': 'Only 18% of reported MPXV cases in 2024 have been tested by PCR'}, {'cause': 'Support provided by WHO and other partners', 'effect': 'Enhanced response capacities to mpox in the country'}, {'cause': ""The GTCV's release of recommendations regarding the use of mpox vaccines."", 'effect': ""The MSPHP's announcement of intent to vaccinate at-risk persons and request for temporary vaccine authorization.""}, {'cause': 'The Ministry announced its intention to vaccinate persons at risk and requested that ACOREP authorize the temporary use of LC16 and MVA-BN vaccinia-based mpox vaccines.', 'effect': 'A regulatory review is underway and further clinical efficacy and safety studies for LC16 are being planned.'}, {'cause': 'Not applicable', 'effect': 'Not applicable'}, {'cause': 'Inadequate risk communication and community engagement', 'effect': 'Low awareness of mpox risks among the general population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo'}, {'cause': 'Ineffective dissemination of health messages to key populations alongside high mobility and multiple partnerships in densely populated mining areas.', 'effect': 'Sustained community transmission of mpox in South Kivu, contributing to the emergence of a new MPXV strain with mutations that enable extended human-to-human transmission and geographic expansion.'}, {'cause': 'Transmission through sexual contact of clade I MPXV among key populations and other groups with multiple partners and high mobility in densely populated mining areas.', 'effect': 'Sustained community transmission in South Kivu.'}, {'cause': 'River boat travel', 'effect': 'Outbreaks in the city'}, {'cause': 'Slow and insufficient resource mobilization combined with limited public awareness and scarce technical and financial support.', 'effect': 'A weakened and delayed public health response to mpox outbreaks across various regions.'}, {'cause': 'Samples were collected and sent to the lab for confirmation.', 'effect': 'Results are currently awaited.'}]"
